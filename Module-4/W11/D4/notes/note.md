Example
Suppose we have a Musician instance musician, and we want to associate two instruments (with IDs 3 and 5) with this musician.

javascript

const musician = await Musician.findByPk(1);
// Find the musician with ID 1
await musician.addInstruments([3, 5]);
// Associate the musician with instruments 3 and 5

The above code will execute the following steps:

Insert two new records into the MusicianInstruments table:
{ musicianId: 1, instrumentId: 3 }
{ musicianId: 1, instrumentId: 5 }
Establish a many-to-many relationship between the musician and these instruments.


Summary
addInstruments is an automatically generated method in Sequelize, used to add multiple instruments (Instrument) to the association of a musician (Musician) in a many-to-many relationship.
It inserts the relevant foreign key data into the join table, establishing the relationship between the musician and the instruments in the database.
